# Homework Repository

Welcome to the Homework (Computer-Performance-Evaluation-Student-Role
) Repository. This repository contains three homework assignments along with their respective solutions. Below is an overview of each assignment.

## Homework 1: M/M/1/K Queue Analysis

**Description:**  
This homework involves the analysis of an M/M/1/K queue system, focusing on its performance evaluation. The main task is to compute various performance metrics and analyze their implications.

**Parameters:**
- **Service Rate (μ):** The rate at which the service is provided.
- **Arrival Rate (λ):** The rate at which arrivals occur.
- **Queue Capacity (K):** Set to 14.

**Key Aspects Covered:**
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculation of the probability of having `n` customers in the system (`P_n`), average number of customers in the system (`N_c`), and probabilities of blocking (`P_b`) and dropping (`P_d`).
- **Simulation Results:** Results showing the impact of varying parameters on system performance.
- **Formulas Used:**
  - `P_n(λ, μ)` for the probability of `n` customers.
  - `N_c` for the average number of customers.
  - Calculation of `P_b` and `P_d` using the provided formulas.
- **Analysis:** Discussion on the impact of different parameters on system performance.

## Homework 2: Round Robin Scheduling Analysis

**Description:**  
This homework involves the analysis of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm within a queue system. It focuses on understanding how the Round Robin mechanism affects performance.

**Key Aspects Covered:**
